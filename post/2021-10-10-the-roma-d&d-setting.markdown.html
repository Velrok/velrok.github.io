A city full of intrigue and political scheming, it houses many powerful guilds. It is the biggest port town in the region, known for the craftsmanship of its many artisans.</p><p><img alt="Roma map" src="/images/blog/2021-10-10-the-roma-dd-setting/map.png" /></p><p>The people of Roma have always been sailors and traders. Their ships are the best on all the seas, sturdy and fast. It is a metropolitan place, especially the docs, full of interesting characters, best avoided at night.</p><p>Many years of favoritism created an aristocracy living in the most prestigious quarters, gated and guarded, only accessible by the powerful and well connected. Many wealthy traders seek access to these spheres of society, all the while failing to understand that they can’t buy their way in with money.</p><p>Change of power comes in the form of elections of the senate every 5 years. It sets off the appointment of a new mayor and sometimes new head judges. If you ask a regular person on the street they will tell you that: there was always murder on the docks, secret violence between the guild, schemming in the senate and corruption at the top. That is the nature of things. As long as trade is plenty and taxes are low the world is good.</p><h2>Magic</h2><p>The city has multiple arch mages, who may keep a couple of apprentices. Magic items are generally rare and can’t be found in shops. There may be special curators who operate on an invitation only system.</p><h3>Religious magic</h3><p>Religion is mostly a non magical affair. There are no priests or clerics in the city that have spells they could use. Magical healing potions are not produced but can only be found.</p><h2>Religion</h2><p><b>Copper dragon (chaotic good) (jokes)</b></p><p><i>Agamos: Brother & Koremmia: Sister</i></p><p>Pranksters, explorers and patrons of new endeavours. Inventors or parties and festivities.</p><p><b>Brass dragon (chaotic good) (talkers)</b></p><p><i>Halgem, Ballorum, Kanish</i></p><p>Rulers of ages past.</p><p>Inventors or the 3 pillars or democracy: The king, the Senate and the Court Culture</p><p>Days of the dragons. Celebrations in honour of Agamos & Koremmia. 3 days of party. Fireworks, dragon masks, food stands, street parties. Time of pranks and practical jokes. Chaos in Roma, suspension of the current power structure. Races Humans make about 50% of the population. Rest is a mix of all races in the player's handbook.</p><h2>Politics</h2><p>King mayor, elected by the senate. Directs senate and writes proposals into law. Head of law enforcement.</p><p>Senat, elected every 5 years. Propose and vote on new laws.</p><p>Courts, judges appointed by king mayor. Head judges enforce consistency of the law and appoint district judges.</p><h2>Central tension</h2><p>My central background tension was Lawful Evil (Devils) vs Chaotic good (Dragons). Devils were scheming in the background, working on a political takeover using blackmail and corruption to win local elections.</p><p>Dragons are in a long slumber and so the heroes have to uncover and expose the threat from within.</p></div></article></div><script type="text/javascript">hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script><footer class="page-footer"><nav><ul><li></li><li><a href="/" id="footer_nav_index">&#8613; index</a></li><li></li></ul></nav></footer><div class="comments"><script async="async" crossorigin="anonymous" issue-term="pathname" label="utterance-comment" repo="Velrok/velrok.github.io" src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" theme="github-light"></script></div></div></body></html>
