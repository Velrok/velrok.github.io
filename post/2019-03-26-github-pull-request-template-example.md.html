All master branches are protected, which means no one is allows to push to master directly, instead one has to open a pull request (PR), which must be approved by at least one other team member. This is mainly to make sure all processing stays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> compliant and people are not accidentally changing software to process more information that it should.</p><p>We also use <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> to organise the communication within the team. Any PR that is opened in any of the projects generates a nicely formatted message in our slack channel. Other team members will either review that PR or simply read the message to keep up to date with the latest changes to the product.</p><p><a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> is our digital card board, which we use to organize our work.</p><h2>An opportunity for improved communication and documentation</h2><p>Since PR's have to be created and are also automatically communicated via Slack they present an opportunity to improve communication.</p><p>I started to make sure that all my PR's would explain the context of a change in the first paragraph and the intended change in what follows. This received good feedback from fellow developers as well as product owners, who started to use the generated slack messages to quickly summarize progress over the last month.</p><p>Since then we started to use GitHub PR templates to introduce a bit more convenience, consistency and project specific elements to most of our pull requests. The templates are used as a guide, to be adjusted as required, but also as a checklist â€“ if applicable.</p><h2>Example PR template</h2><p>Here is an example of our current template for our main analytics product:</p><pre><code class="markdown">[Trello Card](https://trello.com/)

**Context**

&lt;!---
Describe the wider context. How is it affecting users, how has the business changed for this to be relevant.
---&gt;

**Issue**

&lt;!---
Describe the issue at hand usuall a technical issue or a user need.
---&gt;

**Fix / Change / Feature**

&lt;!---
Fix: something was not behaving as intended.
Change: something should behave differently.
Feature: something is new.
---&gt;

 
**Preview**

**Checklist**

works in IE 11

</code></pre><p>Because we use trello, most PR's now include a link to a trello card. A positive side effect is that any spontaneous work like quick bug fixes do end up having a card as well, which is otherwise easily overlooked.</p><p>The template has html comments under <i>Context</i> and <i>Issues</i> which are hopefully good enough to stand for themselves.</p><p>The Fix / Change / Feature section is somewhat controversial, and potentially over engineered. We are still experimenting with its usefulness. One could argue that any good change description would make it obvious what kind of change it is.</p><p>Preview is specific to this project, which has a user interface (UI) component. Attaching a screenshot of the change is often more descriptive than any text and also shows up in the Slack messages, possibly enticing other team members to check it out in production.</p><p>The checklist in this case is also project specific. It reminds us to check any UI changes are compatible with IE11, which we have to support.</p><p>People may delete skip and rename any part of this template. It is meant as a guide rather then a mandatory structure. For example, people my skip the <i>Preview</i> and <i>IE11</i> parts for changes that are not effecting the UI.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We started to use GitHub pull request templates as a optional guide for developers in our team, to leverage it as a communication tool not just for developers but the entire team. This is achieved through the integration with Slack and motivated by the requirement that all changes are made via PR's by the business at large.</p><p>This example template is one that we are using in a small, company internal, cross functional team. Large open source projects have different aims for their pull requests and would probably prefer a template that is more prescriptive.</p><p>We use it as a guide to encourage reflection of the change at hand, and to improve communication within the team. It is entirely optional and should make our lives easier.</p><p>Thank you for your interest.</p></div></article></div><script type="text/javascript">hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script><footer class="page-footer"><nav><ul><li></li><li><a href="/" id="footer_nav_index">&#8613; index</a></li><li></li></ul></nav></footer></div></body></html>
