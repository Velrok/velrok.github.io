So this is an attempt to collect information and sources that I found useful. This article is specifically about Money and basic Banking stuff.</p><p><!--– more –--></p><h2>Choosing a bank account for your income</h2><aside class="link-aside"><div class="link-aside--title">money super market</div><div class="link-aside--url"><a class="link-aside--url--link" href="http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/search/results/?goal=CUR_INTEREST" target="_blank">http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/search/results/?goal=CUR_INTEREST</a></div></aside><p>When you are working in the UK chances are that your employer requires a UK bank account that holds your money in Pounds. "Current Account" is the technical term for an account that is designed to collect your income and pay your bills. I used <a href="http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/search/results/?goal=CUR_INTEREST">money super market</a> to find an account suitable to my needs. They have good how-tos that cover the basics without being lengthy.</p><p>You want to start this early, about 2-3 weeks before you move to the UK. This way your account is already set up and you can wire money into it, which can take days. I missed that and had to hustle with different account debit card limits and  long money transaction times. As soon as you arrive you want to make an appointment to be authenticated.  This will require you to turn up in person at a branch of the bank with your  passport. Only after you have been authenticated can you withdraw money from your new account.</p><p>You might get only a standard migrant account, since you will not have a local address yet. The account you have chosen online will only be available once you can provide a credit score and a local address.</p><h2>Moving money between the UK and your homeland</h2><p>The Current Account might be your primary account for any money business inside the UK but if you want to transfer money to a different country it will probably  get very expensive, because they might charge you as much as 30£ for each transfer. They might also give you a slightly worse conversion rate, compared to what  is possible.</p><aside class="link-aside"><div class="link-aside--title">money.co.uk</div><div class="link-aside--url"><a class="link-aside--url--link" href="http://www.money.co.uk/money-transfers/money-transfer-to-germany.htm" target="_blank">http://www.money.co.uk/money-transfers/money-transfer-to-germany.htm</a></div></aside><aside class="link-aside"><div class="link-aside--title">money.co.uk</div><div class="link-aside--url"><a class="link-aside--url--link" href="http://www.money.co.uk/money-transfers/money-transfer-to-germany.htm" target="_blank">http://www.money.co.uk/money-transfers/money-transfer-to-germany.htm</a></div></aside><p>However there are money transfer institutions that specialize in moving money to different currencies. I used <a href="http://www.money.co.uk/money-transfers/money-transfer-to-germany.htm">money.co.uk</a> to get a list of institutions to choose from. Again which is the best depends on your circumstances, do you transfer money frequently, do you have to transfer large amounts and so forth. <a href="http://www.money.co.uk/money-transfers/money-transfer-to-germany.htm">money.co.uk</a> helped me to find a good fit for my needs (many low amount transactions to my private pension found).</p><h3>bitcoin as an alternative?</h3><aside class="link-aside"><div class="link-aside--title">Bitcoin</div><div class="link-aside--url"><a class="link-aside--url--link" href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-bitcoin/" target="_blank">http://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-bitcoin/</a></div></aside><aside class="link-aside"><div class="link-aside--title">CoinDesk</div><div class="link-aside--url"><a class="link-aside--url--link" href="http://www.coindesk.com/" target="_blank">http://www.coindesk.com/</a></div></aside><p>If you only want to make a few transactions, and want to circumvent the cross country fees, you could try to use a crypto currency like  <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> as an  intermediary currency. I found <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/">CoinDesk</a> to be comprehensible. However at this point this is just an idea I might try in the next days / weeks.</p><h2>Feedback</h2><p>As I said I'm reporting to be best of my knowledge, which isn't much.
