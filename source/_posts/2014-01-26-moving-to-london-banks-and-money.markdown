I moved to London two days ago to start my new job here.
So this is an attempt to collect information and sources that I found useful.
This article is specifically about Money and basic Banking stuff.

## Choosing a bank account for your income

When you are working in the UK chances are that your employer requires a UK
bank account that holds your money in Pounds.
"Current Account" is the technical term for an account that is designed to
collect your income and pay your bills.
I used [money super market](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/search/results/?goal=CUR_INTEREST)
to find an account suitable to my needs.
They have good how-tos that cover the basics without being lengthy.


## Moving money between the UK and your homeland

The Current Account might be your primary account for any money business inside
the UK but if you want to transfer money to a different country it will probably 
get very expensive, because they might charge you as much as 30Â£ for each transfer.
They might also give you a slightly worse conversion rate, compared to what 
is possible.

However there are money transfer institutions that specialize in moving money
to different currencies.
I used [money.co.uk](http://www.money.co.uk/money-transfers/money-transfer-to-germany.htm)
to get a list of institutions to choose from.
Again which is the best depends on your circumstances, do you transfer money
frequently, do you have to transfer large amounts and so forth.
[money.co.uk](http://www.money.co.uk/money-transfers/money-transfer-to-germany.htm)
helped me to find a good fit for my needs (many low amount transactions
to my private pension found).

Everything written is my personal experience. 
I'm not an expert on this topics.

For now all of this is strictly theoretical. As of this writing I have not

Should anything turn out to be totally off or different I will post an update.

I do not receive any money from any of the mentions websites or institutions.

I'm writing this disclaimer just because if came to me :).
